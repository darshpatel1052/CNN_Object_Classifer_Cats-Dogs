CustomPix: Advanced AI-Powered Image Editor
CustomPix is a cutting-edge AI-powered image editing platform that leverages state-of-the-art machine learning models to provide advanced features such as inpainting, object removal, background replacement, and subject substitution. Designed with an intuitive user interface, CustomPix enables seamless real-time editing for diverse image resolutions and formats.

Features
Core Functionalities
Inpainting: Restore missing regions or remove unwanted objects seamlessly.

Object Removal: Erase unwanted objects, defects, or watermarks from images.

Background Replacement: Replace the background with AI-generated content based on text prompts.

Subject Substitution: Replace a subject while preserving the original background.

User Interface (UI/UX) Features
Intuitive drag-and-drop image upload.

Interactive mask editor for drawing or erasing masks.

Text prompt field for generating AI-based edits.

Real-time progress indicators during processing.

Gallery to display editing history and multiple results.

System Requirements
Hardware
A system with a modern GPU (NVIDIA recommended) for optimal performance.

Minimum 8GB RAM (16GB recommended).

Software
Python 3.8 or higher

CUDA Toolkit (if using GPU acceleration)

Supported operating systems: Windows, macOS, Linux

Installation
Clone the repository:

bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/CustomPix.git
cd CustomPix
Create a virtual environment:

bash
python -m venv CUSTOMPIX_ENV
Activate the virtual environment:

On Windows:

bash
CUSTOMPIX_ENV\Scripts\activate
On macOS/Linux:

bash
source CUSTOMPIX_ENV/bin/activate
Install dependencies:

bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
Download pre-trained model weights:

For SAM (Segment Anything Model), download weights from Meta's SAM repository.

For Stable Diffusion Inpainting, weights will be downloaded automatically when first used.

Usage
Run the application:

bash
python src/main.py
Open the Gradio interface in your browser (usually at http://127.0.0.1:7860).

Upload an image, draw masks using the mask editor, and enter a text prompt for inpainting or other edits.

View the processed output and editing history in the gallery.

UI Mockup
Below is a conceptual representation of the CustomPix user interface:

Before Processing:
Users can upload an input image.

Utilize the mask editor to draw or erase areas for editing.

Enter text prompts to guide AI-based edits.

After Processing:
The processed output image is displayed prominently.

A gallery shows previous edits and allows users to revisit their history.

How It Works
Object Selection:

The Segment Anything Model (SAM) generates masks for objects in the uploaded image.

Mask Refinement:

Users can refine masks manually using the interactive editor.

AI-Powered Inpainting:

Stable Diffusion Inpainting replaces masked areas based on user-provided text prompts.

Real-Time Editing:

All operations are performed in real-time with progress indicators for transparency.

History Viewer:

The gallery component allows users to view past edits and compare results.
